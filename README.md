PHP Developer test task
=======================

thank you for applying as PHP Developer!

i should evaluate your programming skills. it won't take much time from you because we designed a test task for quick solving.

could you please look into the test task attached? places where you should change the code are marked by FIXME comments. there are also some not marked defects and drawbacks in the code. do as many fixes and improvements as you can. please be ready to explain why did you choose certain solutions. don't hesitate to ask any questions.

results of the test will be a good basis for a skype call we will schedule later on.
